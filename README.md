little simple python gui for yt-dlp
very simple GUI for "yt-dlp" (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)                                           
supported site : https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md                           
(if you have an error, try to use the original yt-dlp and if you still have the error I advise you to put an issue in the original yt-dlp rather than this one)
